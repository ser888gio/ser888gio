## Hi there 👋

I'm Sergiu, a computer science student currently passionate about building web applications. I leverage TypeScript, Next.js and React to bring ideas to life on the web.

What I'm Working On:

    Expanding my frontend development skills with React.js ⚛️
    Honing my backend development knowledge in C# and Python

Beyond Code:

    I'm comfortable working with databases and utilizing SQL for data manipulation.
    I have strong skills in Computer Networking and plan to develop my skills in Web Security.
    I leverage Figma for designing user interfaces before diving into code.

Looking to:

    Collaborate on open-source projects and contribute to the developer community.
    Learn and grow alongside other passionate programmers.

Feel free to reach out! Let's connect and discuss web development, or anything tech-related!
